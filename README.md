# Metaphor-based-Search-Engine-for-Sinhala-Songs
This project consists of two phases. Building a text corpus of metaphors that are from 100 popular Sinhala songs in the 20th century is done in the first phase. In the second phase, a search application is developed to search Sinhala songs based on introduced queries. Elasticsearch is supposed to be used to develop the search application.
